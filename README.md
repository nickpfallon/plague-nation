# Plague Nation

* This application uses mentions of flu symptoms on Twitter to visually map the locations of those tweets around the world.
* Specific symptoms can be mapped by clicking the button for the symptom under the map, or they can all be mapped at once.
* The map uses clustering of locations based on zoom distance to show where the higher and lower concentrations of flu symptom mentions occur.
